# ft_recursive_power

Welcome to the repository featuring the `ft_recursive_power` function, an elegant recursive implementation for calculating the power of a number. Unlike iterative approaches, this function demonstrates the power of recursion in solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems.

## Function Overview

The `ft_recursive_power` function calculates the result of raising a base number `nb` to an exponent `power`. It illustrates a classic example of recursion, where the function calls itself with a decremented power until it reaches a base case.

### Function Prototype

```c
int ft_recursive_power(int nb, int power);
